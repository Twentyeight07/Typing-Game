# Typing Game

Hi there 👋🏼  
This is a mini game made following the **Microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners** course (link at the end of this readme 👇🏼)

The objective is simple: type as fast as you can. That's it!

if you want to contact me for any reason, this is my email: [eduardofreites1999@gmail.com](mailto:eduardofreites1999@gmail.com)
